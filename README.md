Hello! I am Hriday Mehta. (Batch of 2025)

Firstly, I used docker and docker-compose to build a Rails application with data-base connectivity.
I could then change the port of the local host to 8080 from 3000.

I went through the documentation of Nginx but had difficulty in running the commands on git, as some errors were coming through which I couldn't on StackOverflow or through some documentation. I hope to learn more about web development as this was the first time I have ever used Rails or Docker.
